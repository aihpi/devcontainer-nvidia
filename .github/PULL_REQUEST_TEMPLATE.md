#### Note & instructions:   

##### Commit message title and PR title rules
- like a title (start with capital letter and imperative verb, no dot at the end)
- prefixed with a hashtag and the _issue number_ (*not* PR number)  
- can be a bit longer than simple commit messages if the PR had to do different things      
  
_example_: `#3 Move the azure class to its own bundle, and refactor the interface`    
_note_: this title is important: it will be in the git history, will be displayed in our editor, and help to understand the code
